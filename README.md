# earthquakes
A small study into the geographic and temporal distribution of earthquakes.

The data I'm working with here is from the USGS centennial data set.  See references
in the Jupyter notebook.  I've taken the large fixed-column archive, converted it
first to csv format.  And then trimmed some.

Have only done the very first part of this project so far.
